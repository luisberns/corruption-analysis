# Corruption analysis
Today is possible for us to readily and constantly check information online, over the years more and more people got access to mobile devices and this medium became the main for information exchange and gathering. We can imagine how this can influency society, but we're not going to study how people are interacting or being influenced, we're going to analyze the relations between CPI score of the country, the Number of Internet Users, and the Number of Journalists Killed.

## About the data

We used three datasets*:
- Corruption Perception Index (CPI)
- Number Of Internet Users (# people with internet access)
- Number Of Journalists Killed

**All the datasets were downloaded from [Gap Minder](https://www.gapminder.org)*

We're considering the years from **2012** to **2016** and only countries that had journalists killed during that period.
